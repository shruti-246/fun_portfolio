# Shruti Debnath — Multi-Persona Portfolio

A creative, full-featured portfolio that brings together the **different sides** of my journey — the Developer, the Researcher, the Recruiter, and the human behind it all.  

This project is more than a website; it’s a collection of experiences, thoughts, and projects that define my growth in tech, creativity, and research.

## Overview

The portfolio is divided into **four profiles**, each with its own tone, style, and color palette.  
Every page focuses on a unique aspect of who I am — yet all are connected by a unified design system.

| Persona | Description | Theme |
|----------|--------------|-------|
|  **Developer** | Projects, tools, and open-source experiments | Indigo / Teal (modern & clean) |
|  **Researcher** | Academic interests, literature, and conceptual ideas | Purple (intellectual & calm) |
|  **Recruiter** | Résumé, work experience, and achievements | Emerald green (professional & polished) |
|  **Stalker** | My creative, personal side — hobbies, art, family, and memories | Golden Yellow (warm & lively) |

Each persona has its own navigation, pages, and mood, but they all share the same core — authenticity.

## Design Philosophy 

The design is built around four ideas:
- **Identity through color** — each persona has a distinct color palette that mirrors its tone.
- **Consistency** — shared spacing, layout, and typography unify the design.
- **Minimalism with character** — clean structure, simple animations, and readable typography.
- **Authenticity** — no generic language; every section feels personal and handcrafted.

## Features

- Fully responsive and adaptive layout
- Persona-specific themes with smooth transitions
- Passcode-protected sections for private content
- Dynamic data-driven pages — no need to hardcode text
- Reusable navbar, card, and grid systems
- Animated hover effects and soft shadow transitions
- Modular content updates through /data folder

## Inspirations

This project was inspired by the idea that a portfolio shouldn’t just list achievements — it should tell a story and to create this story I chose the style of **Netflix**
It draws influence from:
- Portfolios that balance professional clarity with personal warmth
- Journals that capture growth, curiosity, and creativity
- Developers and researchers who treat their portfolios as evolving art projects
**“The web isn’t just a showcase. It’s a mirror — of thought, experience, and imagination.”**

## Future Plans

- Add dark/light mode toggle.
- Adding projects and researches I buil something new.
- Add a contact or message page with email integration.
