  intro: `
    Hi! I'm Shruti — a curious and creative soul who loves crafting, and learning new things.
    I’m a Computer Science student who enjoys cooking more than coding and loves listening to music while drawing or painting.
    I believe in making life colorful and meaningful through small joys and thoughtful actions. Sometimes I get lost in emotions and overthink things.
    But I still manage to survive and keep going, one day at a time.
